# hello-world
=============
Test
Other people will say that it’s not a good strategy for backups there, so then I clearly say that you can rethink using EBS Snapshot + ephemeral storage backups, because unzipping some data will be much faster sometimes and you don’t have to entirely rely on this backup as this is the quickest option only, but does not mean it is the safest (i.e EBS Snapshots, third-party cloud backup providers, etc).

# Some heading?
Another test

## How about nested headings?
Seems about right! Now for some lists then:

Bullet:
* Item1
* Item2

Dash:
- Item3
- Item4

Feels absolutely the same :/
